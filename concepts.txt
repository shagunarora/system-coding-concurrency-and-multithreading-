1. Condition Variables:
    a. A condition variable is always associated with a lock. If lock is not provided then a default RLock will be 
       added to the same. Most of our use case, we should provide Lock as multiple different threads in which
       we need to sync the access should share the same lock.
    b. Initialization cv = Condition(lock)
    c. Standard use:
        with cv: # This will acquire underlying lock (check __enter__ and __exit__ method for more clarity in documentation.)
            while condition met:
                cv.wait() # Wait until condition becomes false, this will release the lock.
            
            # Perform the operation on shared lock, you want to Perform
            shared_data.update(new_value)

            # You can also notify some other condition variale if they waiting for this change.
            cv2.notify()
    d. Methods:
            i. wait(timeout=None) # If timeout defined then thread will try to acquire lock and check condition again.
           ii. notify(n=1) # notify only one waiting thread
          iii. notify_all() # Notifies all waiting thread

2. Semaphores:
    a. Semaphores are Locks (Mutex) that manages accessing of shared variable but instead of only 1 thread in case of Mutex,
       in this you can define max number of threads that can access shared data at a time. For e.g. only allowing n threads
       to access db connection at a time.

    b. Initialization: Semaphore(value=max_threads)
        i. By default value = 1 i.e. Semaphore act as Binary Semaphore (same as Mutex)
    
    c. Semaphores internally maintain counter, which decrements on acquire and on release it is incremented.
        i. If counter = 0, then new acquire request is added to waiting queue which is awaken once some another thread 
           releases the same.
    d. Methods:
        i. acquire()
       ii. release()
