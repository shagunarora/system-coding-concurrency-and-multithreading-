"""
Problem Statement:
    - You are building a JobScheduler where:
        - Some jobs depend on other jobs.
        - A job can only run when all its dependencies are completed.

    - We need to expose a function:
        - get_next_jobs_to_run(all_finished_jobs: set) â†’
        - Returns list of jobs whose dependencies are now satisfied and can be scheduled.

    - You must spawn a new thread for each job execution.
    - You must use locks when accessing shared data like job status.

Approach:
    - Create a JobScheduler class which will keep in looking in queue of available jobs to run the job.
    - After completion of any job, get all next eligible jobs and add it to queue.
