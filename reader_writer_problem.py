"""
You are designing a system that is shared by multiple threads, 
some of which perform read operations and others perform write 
operations. The goal is to synchronize access such that:

Rules:
1. Multiple readers can access the shared resource simultaneously.
2. Writers require exclusive access â€” no other readers or writers 
   can access the resource during a write.
3. No data inconsistency should occur due to concurrent access.
4. Avoid starvation:
    a. Optionally, try to ensure writer starvation doesn't happen 
       (some implementations prefer readers, others writers).


Implement the reader-writer logic using threading in Python (or any language), such that:
1. read() method can be called by multiple threads concurrently if no writer is active.
2. write() method must be called by one thread at a time, and only when no readers or 
   writers are active.

Approach:
    - reader_count = 0
    - resource_lock ==> This should be acquired by the first reader to block any writer
                        to perform write. This lock will be released by last reader before
                        leaving read block.
    - reader_lock = Used to update reader_count
