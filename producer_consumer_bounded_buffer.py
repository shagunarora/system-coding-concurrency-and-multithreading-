"""
Problem Statement:

1. One or more producers: threads that generate data and put it into a buffer.
2. One or more consumers: threads that take data from the buffer and process it.

Note: The buffer has limited capacity â€” it can only hold N items at a time. This is the "bounded" part.

Solution:
    1. Create a buffer and define is max_capacity.
    2. There will be multiple threads representing producers and same way multiple threads 
       representing consumers.
    3. Producers should only be able to insert if buffer not full:
        a. Use condition variable is_full to sync between consumers and producers.
    4. Similarly, use is_empty for consumers to notify consumers when buffer not empty.
    5. Both is_empty and is_full condition variable will be associated with the same lock as
       both consumers and producers trying to access same buffer.

Queries: Check concept what happens if I try acquire lock directly instead of cv, what all extra handling
  I will have to do ?

  : How can I add timeout when there is rate imbalance in producer consumer production and consumption
    rate.
